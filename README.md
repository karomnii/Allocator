This allocator written in c, creates alligned memory spaces to length of the machine word. Memory spaces can be also alligned to the memmory pages or used with debug functions.

Files written by me are heap.c, heap.h.
Other than that, there are Unit tests and whole testing structure provided by Politechnika Łódzka.
